# clean-qr

Public garbage is a problem. What if there was a way to leverage the power of crowdfunding and technology to clean it up? Clean-qr is an attempt to do just that. The project conceived at prototyped at the Stamford Hackathon, and uses a trashcan that detects trash deposits, a web service and qr codes to allow people to donate money towards clean ups and receive the money upon completion/use of the trashcan. The idea is currently being fleshed out.
